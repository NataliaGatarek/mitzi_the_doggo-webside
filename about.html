      <p class="mitzi-style">
        Mitzi was born in Greece. As a 2 weeks old puppy, together with 4 of her
        siblings, she was abandoned in a cardboard box in the forest.<br />
        Luckily some good soul found the box full of love and brought it to the
        local shelter in Serres, Greece.<br />There she received her very
        special name and very good care. <br />
        When I saw her on the adoption website, she was only a few months old
        and it was love at first sight. <br />
        I knew that would be my dog and I wanted to bring her to Germany. With
        my boyfriend we went through the adoption process and finally we could
        meet our Mitzi in person. <br />
        She arrived to Germany in September 2019 as a 9 months old puppy. When
        we brought her home everything was new to her, because all what she knew
        until then was the shelter. <br />
        She was welcomed by our two cats and she started her brand new life in
        Berlin. Ofcourse it was a big adjustment and for the first months we
        were working on her fears and building her self confidence. <br />
        Mitzi was afraid of buildings, doors, traffic, bridges and even her own
        shadow. It was a long journey that we went through with small steps and
        big celebrations of her milestone achievements. Every time she would
        cross the bridge or walk through the doors, she would be so happy,<br />
        it was very visible that she understood that she is overcoming her own
        fears.<br />
        A few months ago, Mitzi welcomed a new house member and she realised
        that now she is a big sister. So, she guided and protected little
        Zlata,<br />
        she plays with her and teaches her dog manners. Next to her, Mitzi
        became a self-confident dog that is great with other dogs and with
        people. <br />Mitzi loves adventures, with curiosity she goes to new
        places and enjoys nature.<br />
        Her favourite place is the nearby lake and her favourite game is to run
        circles at full speed. She loves to cuddle on the couch and receive
        treats.<br />
        With love, acceptance, patience and work we overcame Mitzi’s fears and
        helped her to blossom as an amazing dog. She is the best companion and a
        very reliable friend. She made it from the cardboard box in the forest
        in Greece to a great life in Berlin. <br /><br />

      <p class="mitzi-style">
        Zlata is a Spanish Water Dog. <br />She was born on the 6th of April
        2020 in the Bona Espero FCI Poland with breeding name Zefirella. Her
        parents are: mother - Onda Bona Espero FCI and father - Castano Wavelet.
        <br />She became a part of the family when came to Berlin at the end of
        June as a 3 months old puppy. <br />From day 1 she became very attached
        to Mitzi and treated her as her guardian and protector. Since the moment
        Zlata met Mitzi, they liked to sleep together in one bed, snuggle and
        play. <br />Zlata was a very calm puppy, she was not destructive and
        very obedient. We put lots of time and efforts into her socialisation,
        making sure that every other day she is getting to know new situations
        and she can cope with them. <br />Ofcourse, once she entered puberty
        phase, she became a bit more noty, mainly she started to bark a lot and
        she started to have troubles with emotion control. Barking is something
        very normal for SWD breed and we treated this not in the category of 
        the"issue", but more like an opportunity to train her impulse control.
        Consistency and positive reinforcement training helped to manage
        emotions of little Zlata.<br />
        Now she is 1 year old, very obedient, calm and just a perfect dog. She
        loves Mitzi, her best friend, lagotto Baci and two of our cats, that she
        is very desperate to make friends with. <br /><br />
